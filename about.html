<h2>About Dr. Phil</h2>
<p id="about">Dr. Phil McGraw, perhaps the most well-known mental health professional in the world, is the host of the #1 daytime talk show Dr. Phil. Now in its 17th season, this trailblazing and award-winning show continues to provide the most comprehensive forum on mental health issues in the history of television. Dr. McGraw has a unique ability to take complicated and technical information and make it accessible and understandable to the general public. Using the power of television, Dr. McGraw presents compelling stories about real people with a variety of emotional and behavioral problems, stripping away the shame and embarrassment that too often keep people from seeking help. Many viewers, for the first time in their lives, develop an understanding of problems experienced by friends, family members or themselves, and, in the comfort of their homes, experience the hope and possibility of change. Dr. McGraw continues to value his academic training and professional qualifications and insists that the information provided on his show are based on evidence-based treatment options and state-of-the-art research in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and medicine.</p>
